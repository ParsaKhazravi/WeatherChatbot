NOTE: There are no prior requirements or necessary applications needed to run
      the program. Simply run the program in terminal or an IDE.

1) Run Proj1.py

2) Will take approximately 20-30 seconds to load API information

3) The program will prompt you with what degree type you want to use

4) Afterwards, the program will prompt with how to help.

5) Can ask questions about current and past average temperatures (10 years ago)
   of any city in Orange County.

6) Can also ask about the difference in temperature compared to ten years ago.

7) Accepts very limited differences in syntax, thus there are error statements
   for degree type, and also for inputting the question.

8)  Inputs for degree type:
    Fahrenheit
    Celsius
    Kelvin

    Questions for temperatures include:
    "What is temperature in __ now"
    "What is temperature in __ today"
    "What is temperature in __ ten years ago"
    "How has the temperature in __ changed?"

9)  API Personal Keys:
    OpenWeatherMap = 9f3e3db5e1c0af3fd17ac4b853de94ea
    WorldWeatherOnline = 2e3dec233c314781932220412211303 or
                         99e5ffcdadd14b7fbba220609211403 or
                         d7d7d81e4cd44b73b7f225527211503
    There are three keys for WorldWeatherOnline, as there is a limit for the
    amount of calls per day. Thus, I had to make three accounts allowing me to
    constantly check my Chatbot, without worrying about call limits. Any of the
    keys would work.
